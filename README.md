# Computer Vision Repository

Welcome to the **Computer Vision** repository! This repository contains labs, lecture notes, and practice files for the **Computer Vision** course taught by **Dr. Wajid Arshad Abbasi[https://github.com/wajidarshad](https://github.com/wajidarshad)**

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Labs**: Contains lab assignments and practical exercises that demonstrate computer vision techniques and concepts.
- **Lectures**: Includes lecture slides, notes, and explanations of computer vision topics covered during the course.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools Used

This repository focuses on the following:

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing computer vision algorithms.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks like image processing, object detection, and more.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and image plotting.
- **Other Libraries**: Additional libraries depending on specific labs (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
